django project on linked In employee list
I hope you like the code as i have worked really hard on this .
As requested only django and selenium is used to scrap details of the employee .
The code works fine and extracts the information as requested .
However, as selenium sends multiple request my Ip was blocked for some time and after that it become very slow . However, you can check the code. i have done everything to avoid any single error.

Not worked much on frontend . However, it is a decent one and added to response too when scraping is completed.
